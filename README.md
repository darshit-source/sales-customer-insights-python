# Sales & Customer Insights – Python EDA Project

## Project Overview
This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on sales and customer data to understand purchasing patterns, customer behavior, and overall sales trends. The analysis focuses on cleaning raw data, exploring key variables, and visualizing insights that can support business decision-making.

## Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains sales and customer-related information, including:
- Order ID
- Customer details (age, gender)
- Sales values
- Order dates
- Product and category information

## Analysis Performed
- Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values and data types)
- Descriptive statistics to understand data distribution
- Customer segmentation based on age and gender
- Sales trend analysis over time
- Correlation analysis between key variables
- Data visualization using charts and graphs

## Key Insights
- Identified high-performing customer segments
- Observed purchasing behavior differences across age groups and genders
- Detected sales patterns and seasonal trends
- Highlighted factors influencing total sales performance

## Visualizations
- Bar charts for customer segmentation
- Line charts for sales trends
- Distribution plots for numerical variables

## Conclusion
The project demonstrates how Python-based exploratory data analysis can be used to extract meaningful insights from raw sales data. The findings can help businesses better understand their customers and optimize sales strategies.
